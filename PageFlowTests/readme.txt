The purpose of those processes is to test the page flow between forms.
The processes to deploy are the ones with the _pp in the name. They are "Pre-Processed" by a personal tool
that add the tedious page flow mapping and some other things I use in my processes.
The page flow mapping in the original process is made by the arrow from a form-complete to a form-create 
in the not executable pool.
This notation is not standard but helps me to make page flow faster.
